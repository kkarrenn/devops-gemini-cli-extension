# Base images    Stay organized with collections      Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

A base image is the starting point for most container-based development workflows.
Developers start with a base image and layer on top of it the necessary libraries,
binaries, and configuration files used to run their application. Google Cloud's buildpacks
publishes base images with multiple configurations of the available system packages and languages.

Security and maintenance updates to these base images are made available through
routine updates. Google Cloud's buildpacks applies these updates automatically or
lets you manually update, depending on the environment and your configuration.
For example, Cloud Run functions supports [automatic updates](/run/docs/configuring/services/automatic-base-image-updates).

Base images are hosted in every region where Artifact Registry is available.
You can customize the base image path by replacing the first portion of the URI
with your region of choice:

`REGION-docker.pkg.dev/serverless-runtimes/STACK/runtimes/RUNTIME_ID`

Replace:

- REGION with the preferred region, for example `us-central1`.
- STACK with the preferred operating system stack, for example `google-24`.
- RUNTIME\_ID with the runtime ID used by your function, for example `python313`.

For example, buildpacks references the Node.js 24 base image using the `google-24` stack,
hosted in `us-central1` with the following URL:
`us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/serverless-runtimes/google-24/runtimes/nodejs24`.
