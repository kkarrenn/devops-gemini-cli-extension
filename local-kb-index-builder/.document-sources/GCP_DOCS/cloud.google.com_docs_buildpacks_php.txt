# Building a PHP application    Stay organized with collections      Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

## Specify the PHP version

By default the PHP Runtime buildpack uses the latest stable version of PHP. If
your application requires a specific version, you can specify one by including
a `composer.json` file in your application's root directory. For example:

```
"require": {
  "php": "8.3.*",
}

```

## Configure Composer

By default, the Composer version is `2.1.3`. If you require a specific
version of Composer, you can use the `GOOGLE_COMPOSER_VERSION` environment
variable to specify any supported version of Composer using the full
semantic version. For example:

```
pack build sample-php --builder=gcr.io/buildpacks/builder \
  --env GOOGLE_COMPOSER_VERSION="2.2.20"

```

## Customizing NGINX configurations

To configure NGINX, you can use the `GOOGLE_CUSTOM_NGINX_CONFIG` environment
variable to specify your custom NGINX configuration file. For example:

```
pack build sample-php --builder=gcr.io/buildpacks/builder \
  --env GOOGLE_CUSTOM_NGINX_CONFIG="nginx-custom.conf"

```

When NGINX starts, your custom NGINX file is used.
