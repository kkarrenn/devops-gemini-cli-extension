# Glossary [¶](\#glossary "Link to this heading")

Binary Distribution [¶](#term-Binary-Distribution "Link to this term")

A specific kind of [Built Distribution](#term-Built-Distribution) that contains compiled
extensions.

Build Backend [¶](#term-Build-Backend "Link to this term")

A library that takes a source tree
and builds a [source distribution](#term-Source-Distribution-or-sdist) or
[built distribution](#term-Built-Distribution) from it.
The build is delegated to the backend by a
[frontend](#term-Build-Frontend).
All backends offer a standardized interface.

Examples of build backends are
[flit’s flit-core](../key_projects/#flit),
[hatch’s hatchling](../key_projects/#hatch),
[Maturin](../key_projects/#maturin),
[meson-python](../key_projects/#meson-python),
[scikit-build-core](../key_projects/#scikit-build-core),
and [Setuptools](../key_projects/#setuptools).

Build Frontend [¶](#term-Build-Frontend "Link to this term")

A tool that users might run
that takes arbitrary source trees or
[source distributions](#term-Source-Distribution-or-sdist)
and builds source distributions or [wheels](#term-Wheel) from them.
The actual building is delegated to each source tree’s
[build backend](#term-Build-Backend).

Examples of build frontends are [pip](../key_projects/#pip) and [build](../key_projects/#build).

Built Distribution [¶](#term-Built-Distribution "Link to this term")

A [Distribution](#term-Distribution-Package) format containing files
and metadata that only need to be moved to the correct location on the
target system, to be installed. [Wheel](#term-Wheel) is such a format, whereas
[Source Distribution](#term-Source-Distribution-or-sdist) is not, in that it requires a build step before it can be
installed. This format does not imply that Python files have to be
precompiled ( [Wheel](#term-Wheel) intentionally does not include compiled
Python files). See [Package Formats](../discussions/package-formats/#package-formats) for more information.

Built Metadata [¶](#term-Built-Metadata "Link to this term")

The concrete form [Core Metadata](#term-Core-Metadata) takes
when included inside an installed [Project](#term-Project) ( `METADATA` file)
or a [Distribution Archive](#term-Distribution-Archive)
( `PKG-INFO` in a
[Sdist](#term-Source-Distribution-or-sdist)
and `METADATA` in a [Wheel](#term-Wheel)).

Core Metadata [¶](#term-Core-Metadata "Link to this term")

The [specification](../specifications/core-metadata/#core-metadata)
and the set of [Core Metadata Field](#term-Core-Metadata-Field) s it defines
that describe key static attributes of
a [Distribution Package](#term-Distribution-Package) or [Installed Project](#term-Installed-Project).

Core Metadata Field [¶](#term-Core-Metadata-Field "Link to this term")

A single key-value pair
(or sequence of such with the same name, for multiple-use fields)
defined in the [Core Metadata](#term-Core-Metadata) spec
and stored in the [Built Metadata](#term-Built-Metadata).
Notably, distinct from a [Pyproject Metadata Key](#term-Pyproject-Metadata-Key).

Distribution Archive [¶](#term-Distribution-Archive "Link to this term")

The physical distribution artifact (i.e. a file on disk)
for a [Distribution Package](#term-Distribution-Package).

Distribution Package [¶](#term-Distribution-Package "Link to this term")

A versioned archive file that contains Python [packages](#term-Import-Package), [modules](#term-Module), and other resource files that are
used to distribute a [Release](#term-Release). The archive file is what an
end-user will download from the internet and install.

A distribution package is more commonly referred to with the single
words “package” or “distribution”, but this guide may use the expanded
term when more clarity is needed to prevent confusion with an
[Import Package](#term-Import-Package) (which is also commonly called a “package”) or
another kind of distribution (e.g. a Linux distribution or the Python
language distribution), which are often referred to with the single term
“distribution”. See [Distribution package vs. import package](../discussions/distribution-package-vs-import-package/#distribution-package-vs-import-package)
for a breakdown of the differences.

Egg [¶](#term-Egg "Link to this term")

A [Built Distribution](#term-Built-Distribution) format introduced by [Setuptools](../key_projects/#setuptools),
which has been replaced by [Wheel](#term-Wheel). For details, see
[What about eggs?](../discussions/package-formats/#egg-format).

Extension Module [¶](#term-Extension-Module "Link to this term")

A [Module](#term-Module) written in the low-level language of the Python implementation:
C/C++ for Python, Java for Jython. Typically contained in a single
dynamically loadable pre-compiled file, e.g. a shared object (.so) file
for Python extensions on Unix, a DLL (given the .pyd extension) for
Python extensions on Windows, or a Java class file for Jython
extensions.

Import Package [¶](#term-Import-Package "Link to this term")

A Python module which can contain other modules or recursively, other
packages.

An import package is more commonly referred to with the single word
“package”, but this guide will use the expanded term when more clarity
is needed to prevent confusion with a [Distribution Package](#term-Distribution-Package) which
is also commonly called a “package”. See [Distribution package vs. import package](../discussions/distribution-package-vs-import-package/#distribution-package-vs-import-package)
for a breakdown of the differences.

Installed Project [¶](#term-Installed-Project "Link to this term")

A [Project](#term-Project) that is installed for use with
a Python interpreter or [Virtual Environment](#term-Virtual-Environment),
as described in the specification [Recording installed projects](../specifications/recording-installed-packages/#recording-installed-packages).

Known Good Set (KGS) [¶](#term-Known-Good-Set-KGS "Link to this term")

A set of distributions at specified versions which are compatible with
each other. Typically a test suite will be run which passes all tests
before a specific set of packages is declared a known good set. This
term is commonly used by frameworks and toolkits which are comprised of
multiple individual distributions.

License Classifier [¶](#term-License-Classifier "Link to this term")

A PyPI Trove classifier
(as [described](../specifications/core-metadata/#core-metadata-classifier)
in the [Core Metadata](#term-Core-Metadata) specification)
which begins with `License ::`.

License Expression [¶](#term-License-Expression "Link to this term")SPDX Expression [¶](#term-SPDX-Expression "Link to this term")

A string with valid SPDX license expression syntax,
including one or more SPDX [License Identifier](#term-License-Identifier)(s),
which describes a [Distribution Archive](#term-Distribution-Archive)’s license(s)
and how they inter-relate.
Examples:
`GPL-3.0-or-later`,
`MIT AND (Apache-2.0 OR BSD-2-Clause)`

License Identifier [¶](#term-License-Identifier "Link to this term")SPDX Identifier [¶](#term-SPDX-Identifier "Link to this term")

A valid SPDX short-form license identifier,
originally specified in [**PEP 639**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0639/).
This includes all valid SPDX identifiers and
the custom `LicenseRef-[idstring]` strings conforming to the
SPDX specification.
Examples:
`MIT`,
`GPL-3.0-only`,
`LicenseRef-My-Custom-License`

Module [¶](#term-Module "Link to this term")

The basic unit of code reusability in Python, existing in one of two
types: [Pure Module](#term-Pure-Module), or [Extension Module](#term-Extension-Module).

Package Index [¶](#term-Package-Index "Link to this term")

A repository of distributions with a web interface to automate
[package](#term-Distribution-Package) discovery and consumption.

Per Project Index [¶](#term-Per-Project-Index "Link to this term")

A private or other non-canonical [Package Index](#term-Package-Index) indicated by
a specific [Project](#term-Project) as the index preferred or required to
resolve dependencies of that project.

Project [¶](#term-Project "Link to this term")

A library, framework, script, plugin, application, or collection of data
or other resources, or some combination thereof that is intended to be
packaged into a [Distribution](#term-Distribution-Package).

Since most projects create [Distributions](#term-Distribution-Package)
using either [**PEP 518**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0518/) `build-system`, [distutils](../key_projects/#distutils) or
[Setuptools](../key_projects/#setuptools), another practical way to define projects currently
is something that contains a [pyproject.toml](#term-pyproject.toml), [setup.py](#term-setup.py),
or [setup.cfg](#term-setup.cfg) file at the root of the project source directory.

Python projects must have unique names, which are registered on
[PyPI](#term-Python-Package-Index-PyPI). Each project will then
contain one or more [Releases](#term-Release), and each release may
comprise one or more [distributions](#term-Distribution-Package).

Note that there is a strong convention to name a project after the name
of the package that is imported to run that project. However, this
doesn’t have to hold true. It’s possible to install a distribution from
the project ‘foo’ and have it provide a package importable only as
‘bar’.

Project Root Directory [¶](#term-Project-Root-Directory "Link to this term")

The filesystem directory in which
a [Project](#term-Project)’s [source tree](#term-Project-Source-Tree) is located.

Project Source Tree [¶](#term-Project-Source-Tree "Link to this term")

The on-disk format of a [Project](#term-Project) used for development,
containing its raw source code before being packaged
into a
[Source Distribution](#term-Source-Distribution-or-sdist)
or [Built Distribution](#term-Built-Distribution).

Project Source Metadata [¶](#term-Project-Source-Metadata "Link to this term")

Metadata defined by the package author
in a [Project](#term-Project)’s [source tree](#term-Project-Source-Tree),
to be transformed into [Core Metadata field](#term-Core-Metadata-Field) s
in the [Built Metadata](#term-Built-Metadata)
by the project’s [build backend](#term-Build-Backend).
Can be written as [Pyproject Metadata](#term-Pyproject-Metadata),
or in a tool-specific format
(under the `[tool]` table in `pyproject.toml`,
or in a tool’s own configuration file).

Pure Module [¶](#term-Pure-Module "Link to this term")

A [Module](#term-Module) written in Python and contained in a single `.py` file (and
possibly associated `.pyc` and/or `.pyo` files).

Pyproject Metadata [¶](#term-Pyproject-Metadata "Link to this term")

The [Project Source Metadata](#term-Project-Source-Metadata) format
defined by the [pyproject.toml specification](../specifications/pyproject-toml/#declaring-project-metadata) specification
and originally introduced in [**PEP 621**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0621/),
stored as [Pyproject Metadata Key](#term-Pyproject-Metadata-Key) s
under the `[project]` table of a [pyproject.toml](#term-pyproject.toml) file.
Notably, _not_ a tool-specific source metadata format
under the `[tool]` table in `pyproject.toml`.

Pyproject Metadata Key [¶](#term-Pyproject-Metadata-Key "Link to this term")

A top-level TOML key in the `[project]` table in `pyproject.toml`;
part of the [Pyproject Metadata](#term-Pyproject-Metadata).

A second-level TOML key under a table-valued
[Pyproject Metadata Key](#term-Pyproject-Metadata-Key).

Python Packaging Authority (PyPA) [¶](#term-Python-Packaging-Authority-PyPA "Link to this term")

PyPA is a working group that maintains many of the relevant
projects in Python packaging. They maintain a site at
[pypa.io](https://www.pypa.io/en/latest/ "(in PyPA)"), host projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/pypa), and discuss issues on the
[distutils-sig mailing list](https://mail.python.org/mailman3/lists/distutils-sig.python.org/)
and [the Python Discourse forum](https://discuss.python.org/c/packaging).

Python Package Index (PyPI) [¶](#term-Python-Package-Index-PyPI "Link to this term")

[PyPI](https://pypi.org) is the default [Package\
Index](#term-Package-Index) for the Python community. It is open to all Python developers to
consume and distribute their distributions.

pypi.org [¶](#term-pypi.org "Link to this term")

[pypi.org](https://pypi.org) is the domain name for the
[Python Package Index (PyPI)](#term-Python-Package-Index-PyPI). It replaced the legacy index
domain name, `pypi.python.org`, in 2017. It is powered by
[Warehouse](../key_projects/#warehouse).

pyproject.toml [¶](#term-pyproject.toml "Link to this term")

The tool-agnostic [Project](#term-Project) specification file.
Defined in [**PEP 518**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0518/).

Release [¶](#term-Release "Link to this term")

A snapshot of a [Project](#term-Project) at a particular point in time, denoted
by a version identifier.

Making a release may entail the publishing of multiple
[Distributions](#term-Distribution-Package). For example, if version
1.0 of a project was released, it could be available in both a source
distribution format and a Windows installer distribution format.

Requirement [¶](#term-Requirement "Link to this term")

A specification for a [package](#term-Distribution-Package) to be
installed. [pip](../key_projects/#pip), the [PYPA](#term-Python-Packaging-Authority-PyPA) recommended installer, allows various forms of specification
that can all be considered a “requirement”. For more information, see the
[pip install](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/cli/pip_install/#pip-install "(in pip v26.0)") reference.

Requirement Specifier [¶](#term-Requirement-Specifier "Link to this term")

A format used by [pip](../key_projects/#pip) to install packages from a [Package\
Index](#term-Package-Index). For an EBNF diagram of the format, see [Dependency specifiers](../specifications/dependency-specifiers/#dependency-specifiers).
For example, “foo>=1.3” is a
requirement specifier, where “foo” is the project name, and the “>=1.3”
portion is the [Version Specifier](#term-Version-Specifier)

Requirements File [¶](#term-Requirements-File "Link to this term")

A file containing a list of [Requirements](#term-Requirement) that can
be installed using [pip](../key_projects/#pip). For more information, see the [pip](../key_projects/#pip)
docs on [Requirements Files](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/user_guide/#requirements-files "(in pip v26.0)").

The directory under which license files are stored in a
[Project Source Tree](#term-Project-Source-Tree), [Distribution Archive](#term-Distribution-Archive)
or [Installed Project](#term-Installed-Project).
For a [Project Source Tree](#term-Project-Source-Tree) or
[Source Distribution (or “sdist”)](#term-Source-Distribution-or-sdist), this is the
[Project Root Directory](#term-Project-Root-Directory).
For a [Built Distribution](#term-Built-Distribution) or [Installed Project](#term-Installed-Project),
this is the `.dist-info/licenses/` directory of
the wheel archive or project folder respectively.
Also, the root directory that paths
recorded in the `License-File` [Core Metadata Field](#term-Core-Metadata-Field) are relative to.

setup.py [¶](#term-setup.py "Link to this term")setup.cfg [¶](#term-setup.cfg "Link to this term")

The project specification files for [distutils](../key_projects/#distutils) and [Setuptools](../key_projects/#setuptools).
See also [pyproject.toml](#term-pyproject.toml).

Source Archive [¶](#term-Source-Archive "Link to this term")

An archive containing the raw source code for a [Release](#term-Release), prior
to creation of a [Source Distribution](#term-Source-Distribution-or-sdist) or [Built Distribution](#term-Built-Distribution).

Source Distribution (or “sdist”) [¶](#term-Source-Distribution-or-sdist "Link to this term")

A [distribution](#term-Distribution-Archive) format (usually generated
using `python -m build --sdist`) that provides metadata and the
essential source files needed for installing by a tool like [pip](../key_projects/#pip),
or for generating a [Built Distribution](#term-Built-Distribution). See [Package Formats](../discussions/package-formats/#package-formats)
for more information.

System Package [¶](#term-System-Package "Link to this term")

A package provided in a format native to the operating system,
e.g. an rpm or dpkg file.

Version Specifier [¶](#term-Version-Specifier "Link to this term")

The version component of a [Requirement Specifier](#term-Requirement-Specifier). For example,
the “>=1.3” portion of “foo>=1.3”. Read the [Version specifier specification](../specifications/version-specifiers/#version-specifiers) for a full description of the
specifiers that Python packaging currently supports. Support for this
specification was implemented in [Setuptools](../key_projects/#setuptools) v8.0 and [pip](../key_projects/#pip) v6.0.

Virtual Environment [¶](#term-Virtual-Environment "Link to this term")

An isolated Python environment that allows packages to be installed for
use by a particular application, rather than being installed system
wide. For more information, see the section on [Creating Virtual Environments](../tutorials/installing-packages/#creating-and-using-virtual-environments).

Wheel Format [¶](#term-Wheel-Format "Link to this term")Wheel [¶](#term-Wheel "Link to this term")

The standard [Built Distribution](#term-Built-Distribution) format
originally introduced in [**PEP 427**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0427/)
and defined by the [Binary distribution format](../specifications/binary-distribution-format/#binary-distribution-format) specification.
See [Package Formats](../discussions/package-formats/#package-formats) for more information.
Not to be confused with its reference implementation,
the [Wheel Project](#term-Wheel-Project).

Wheel Project [¶](#term-Wheel-Project "Link to this term")

The PyPA reference implementation of the [Wheel Format](#term-Wheel-Format); see [wheel](../key_projects/#wheel).

Working Set [¶](#term-Working-Set "Link to this term")

A collection of [distributions](#term-Distribution-Package) available
for importing. These are the distributions that are on the [`sys.path`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.path "(in Python v3.14)")
variable. At most, one [Distribution](#term-Distribution-Package) for a
project is possible in a working set.
