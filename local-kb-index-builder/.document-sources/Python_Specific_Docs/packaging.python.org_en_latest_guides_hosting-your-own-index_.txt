# Hosting your own simple repository [¶](\#hosting-your-own-simple-repository "Link to this heading")

If you wish to host your own simple repository [\[1\]](#id4), you can either use a
software package like [devpi](https://devpi.net/docs/devpi/devpi/latest/+doc/index.html "(in devpi v6.17)") or you can simply create the proper
directory structure and use any web server that can serve static files and
generate an autoindex.

In either case, since you’ll be hosting a repository that is likely not in
your user’s default repositories, you should instruct them in your project’s
description to configure their installer appropriately. For example with pip:

Unix/macOS

```
python3 -m pip install --extra-index-url https://python.example.com/ foobar

```

Windows

```
py -m pip install --extra-index-url https://python.example.com/ foobar

```

In addition, it is **highly** recommended that you serve your repository with
valid HTTPS. At this time, the security of your user’s installations depends on
all repositories using a valid HTTPS setup.

## “Manual” repository [¶](\#manual-repository "Link to this heading")

The directory layout is fairly simple, within a root directory you need to
create a directory for each project. This directory should be the [normalized name](../../specifications/name-normalization/#name-normalization) of the project. Within each of these directories
simply place each of the downloadable files. If you have the projects “Foo”
(with the versions 1.0 and 2.0) and “bar” (with the version 0.1) You should
end up with a structure that looks like:

```
.
├── bar
│   └── bar-0.1.tar.gz
└── foo
    ├── Foo-1.0.tar.gz
    └── Foo-2.0.tar.gz

```

Once you have this layout, simply configure your webserver to serve the root
directory with autoindex enabled. For an example using the built in Web server
in [Twisted](https://twistedmatrix.com/), you would simply run `twistd -n web --path .` and then
instruct users to add the URL to their installer’s configuration.
