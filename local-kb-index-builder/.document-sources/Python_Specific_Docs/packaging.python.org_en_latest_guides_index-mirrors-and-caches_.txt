Mirroring or caching of PyPI (and other
[package indexes](../../glossary/#term-Package-Index)) can be used to speed up local
package installation,
allow offline work, handle corporate firewalls or just plain Internet flakiness.

There are multiple classes of options in this area:

1. local/hosted caching of package indexes.

2. local/hosted mirroring of a package index. A mirror is a (whole or
   partial) copy of a package index, which can be used in place of the
   original index.

3. private package index with fall-through to public package indexes (for
   example, to mitigate dependency confusion attacks), also known as a
   proxy.


## Caching with pip [¶](\#caching-with-pip "Link to this heading")

pip provides a number of facilities for speeding up installation by using local
cached copies of [packages](../../glossary/#term-Distribution-Package):

1. [Fast & local installs](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/user_guide/#installing-from-local-packages "(in pip v26.0)")
   by downloading all the requirements for a project and then pointing pip at
   those downloaded files instead of going to PyPI.

2. A variation on the above which pre-builds the installation files for
   the requirements using [python3 -m pip wheel](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/cli/pip_wheel/#pip-wheel "(in pip v26.0)"):





   ```
   python3 -m pip wheel --wheel-dir=/tmp/wheelhouse SomeProject
   python3 -m pip install --no-index --find-links=/tmp/wheelhouse SomeProject

   ```
