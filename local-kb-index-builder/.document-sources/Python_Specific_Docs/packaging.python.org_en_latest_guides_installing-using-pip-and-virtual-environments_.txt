# Install packages in a virtual environment using pip and venv [¶](\#install-packages-in-a-virtual-environment-using-pip-and-venv "Link to this heading")

This guide discusses how to create and activate a virtual environment using
the standard library’s virtual environment tool [venv](../../key_projects/#venv) and install packages.
The guide covers how to:

- Create and activate a virtual environment

- Prepare pip

- Install packages into a virtual environment using the `pip` command

- Use and create a requirements file


Note

This guide applies to supported versions of Python, currently 3.8
and higher.

Note

This guide uses the term **package** to refer to a
[Distribution Package](../../glossary/#term-Distribution-Package), which commonly is installed from an external
host. This differs from the term [Import Package](../../glossary/#term-Import-Package) which refers to
import modules in your Python source code.

Important

This guide has the prerequisite that you are using an official Python version obtained from
< [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/) >. If you are using your operating
system’s package manager to install Python, please ensure that Python is
installed before proceeding with these steps.

## Create and Use Virtual Environments [¶](\#create-and-use-virtual-environments "Link to this heading")

### Create a new virtual environment [¶](\#create-a-new-virtual-environment "Link to this heading")

[venv](../../key_projects/#venv) (for Python 3) allows you to manage separate package installations for
different projects. It creates a “virtual” isolated Python installation. When
you switch projects, you can create a new virtual environment which is isolated
from other virtual environments. You benefit from the virtual environment
since packages can be installed confidently and will not interfere with
another project’s environment.

Tip

It is recommended to use a virtual environment when working with third
party packages.

To create a virtual environment, go to your project’s directory and run the
following command. This will create a new virtual environment in a local folder
named `.venv`:

Unix/macOS

```
python3 -m venv .venv

```

Windows

```
py -m venv .venv

```

The second argument is the location to create the virtual environment. Generally, you
can just create this in your project and call it `.venv`.

`venv` will create a virtual Python installation in the `.venv` folder.

Note

You should exclude your virtual environment directory from your version
control system using `.gitignore` or similar.

### Activate a virtual environment [¶](\#activate-a-virtual-environment "Link to this heading")

Before you can start installing or using packages in your virtual environment you’ll
need to `activate` it. Activating a virtual environment will put the
virtual environment-specific `python` and `pip` executables into your
shell’s `PATH`.

Unix/macOS

```
source .venv/bin/activate

```

Windows

```
.venv\Scripts\activate

```

To confirm the virtual environment is activated, check the location of your
Python interpreter:

Unix/macOS

```
which python

```

Windows

```
where python

```

While the virtual environment is active, the above command will output a
filepath that includes the `.venv` directory, by ending with the following:

Unix/macOS

```
.venv/bin/python

```

Windows

```
.venv\Scripts\python

```

While a virtual environment is activated, pip will install packages into that
specific environment. This enables you to import and use packages in your
Python application.

### Deactivate a virtual environment [¶](\#deactivate-a-virtual-environment "Link to this heading")

If you want to switch projects or leave your virtual environment,
`deactivate` the environment:

```
deactivate

```

Note

Closing your shell will deactivate the virtual environment. If
you open a new shell window and want to use the virtual environment,
reactivate it.

### Reactivate a virtual environment [¶](\#reactivate-a-virtual-environment "Link to this heading")

If you want to reactivate an existing virtual environment, follow the same
instructions about activating a virtual environment. There’s no need to create
a new virtual environment.

## Prepare pip [¶](\#prepare-pip "Link to this heading")

[pip](../../key_projects/#pip) is the reference Python package manager.
It’s used to install and update packages into a virtual environment.

Unix/macOS

The Python installers for macOS include pip. On Linux, you may have to install
an additional package such as `python3-pip`. You can make sure that pip is
up-to-date by running:

```
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
python3 -m pip --version

```

Afterwards, you should have the latest version of pip installed in your
user site:

```
pip 23.3.1 from .../.venv/lib/python3.9/site-packages (python 3.9)

```

Windows

The Python installers for Windows include pip. You can make sure that pip is
up-to-date by running:

```
py -m pip install --upgrade pip
py -m pip --version

```

Afterwards, you should have the latest version of pip:

```
pip 23.3.1 from .venv\lib\site-packages (Python 3.9.4)

```

## Install packages using pip [¶](\#install-packages-using-pip "Link to this heading")

When your virtual environment is activated, you can install packages. Use the
`pip install` command to install packages.

### Install a package [¶](\#install-a-package "Link to this heading")

For example, let’s install the
[Requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/) library from the [Python Package Index (PyPI)](../../glossary/#term-Python-Package-Index-PyPI):

Unix/macOS

```
python3 -m pip install requests

```

Windows

```
py -m pip install requests

```

pip should download requests and all of its dependencies and install them:

```
Collecting requests
  Using cached requests-2.18.4-py2.py3-none-any.whl
Collecting chardet<3.1.0,>=3.0.2 (from requests)
  Using cached chardet-3.0.4-py2.py3-none-any.whl
Collecting urllib3<1.23,>=1.21.1 (from requests)
  Using cached urllib3-1.22-py2.py3-none-any.whl
Collecting certifi>=2017.4.17 (from requests)
  Using cached certifi-2017.7.27.1-py2.py3-none-any.whl
Collecting idna<2.7,>=2.5 (from requests)
  Using cached idna-2.6-py2.py3-none-any.whl
Installing collected packages: chardet, urllib3, certifi, idna, requests
Successfully installed certifi-2017.7.27.1 chardet-3.0.4 idna-2.6 requests-2.18.4 urllib3-1.22

```

### Install a specific package version [¶](\#install-a-specific-package-version "Link to this heading")

pip allows you to specify which version of a package to install using
[version specifiers](../../glossary/#term-Version-Specifier). For example, to install
a specific version of `requests`:

Unix/macOS

```
python3 -m pip install 'requests==2.18.4'

```

Windows

```
py -m pip install "requests==2.18.4"

```

To install the latest `2.x` release of requests:

Unix/macOS

```
python3 -m pip install 'requests>=2.0.0,<3.0.0'

```

Windows

```
py -m pip install "requests>=2.0.0,<3.0.0"

```

To install pre-release versions of packages, use the `--pre` flag:

Unix/macOS

```
python3 -m pip install --pre requests

```

Windows

```
py -m pip install --pre requests

```

### Install extras [¶](\#install-extras "Link to this heading")

Some packages have optional [extras](https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/userguide/dependency_management.html#optional-dependencies). You can tell pip to install these by
specifying the extra in brackets:

Unix/macOS

```
python3 -m pip install 'requests[security]'

```

Windows

```
py -m pip install "requests[security]"

```

### Install a package from source [¶](\#install-a-package-from-source "Link to this heading")

pip can install a package directly from its source code. For example, to install
the source code in the `google-auth` directory:

Unix/macOS

```
cd google-auth
python3 -m pip install .

```

Windows

```
cd google-auth
py -m pip install .

```

Additionally, pip can install packages from source in
[development mode](https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/development_mode.html "(in setuptools v80.10.0)"),
meaning that changes to the source directory will immediately affect the
installed package without needing to re-install:

Unix/macOS

```
python3 -m pip install --editable .

```

Windows

```
py -m pip install --editable .

```

### Install from version control systems [¶](\#install-from-version-control-systems "Link to this heading")

pip can install packages directly from their version control system. For
example, you can install directly from a git repository:

```
google-auth @ git+https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/google-auth-library-python.git

```

For more information on supported version control systems and syntax, see pip’s
documentation on [VCS Support](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/topics/vcs-support/#vcs-support "(in pip v26.0)").

### Install from local archives [¶](\#install-from-local-archives "Link to this heading")

If you have a local copy of a [Distribution Package](../../glossary/#term-Distribution-Package)’s archive (a zip,
wheel, or tar file) you can install it directly with pip:

Unix/macOS

```
python3 -m pip install requests-2.18.4.tar.gz

```

Windows

```
py -m pip install requests-2.18.4.tar.gz

```

If you have a directory containing archives of multiple packages, you can tell
pip to look for packages there and not to use the
[Python Package Index (PyPI)](../../glossary/#term-Python-Package-Index-PyPI) at all:

Unix/macOS

```
python3 -m pip install --no-index --find-links=/local/dir/ requests

```

Windows

```
py -m pip install --no-index --find-links=/local/dir/ requests

```

This is useful if you are installing packages on a system with limited
connectivity or if you want to strictly control the origin of distribution
packages.

### Install from other package indexes [¶](\#install-from-other-package-indexes "Link to this heading")

If you want to download packages from a different index than the
[Python Package Index (PyPI)](../../glossary/#term-Python-Package-Index-PyPI), you can use the `--index-url` flag:

Unix/macOS

```
python3 -m pip install --index-url http://index.example.com/simple/ SomeProject

```

Windows

```
py -m pip install --index-url http://index.example.com/simple/ SomeProject

```

If you want to allow packages from both the [Python Package Index (PyPI)](../../glossary/#term-Python-Package-Index-PyPI)
and a separate index, you can use the `--extra-index-url` flag instead:

Unix/macOS

```
python3 -m pip install --extra-index-url http://index.example.com/simple/ SomeProject

```

Windows

```
py -m pip install --extra-index-url http://index.example.com/simple/ SomeProject

```

## Upgrading packages [¶](\#upgrading-packages "Link to this heading")

pip can upgrade packages in-place using the `--upgrade` flag. For example, to
install the latest version of `requests` and all of its dependencies:

Unix/macOS

```
python3 -m pip install --upgrade requests

```

Windows

```
py -m pip install --upgrade requests

```

## Using a requirements file [¶](\#using-a-requirements-file "Link to this heading")

Instead of installing packages individually, pip allows you to declare all
dependencies in a [Requirements File](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/user_guide/#requirements-files "(in pip v26.0)"). For
example you could create a `requirements.txt` file containing:

```
requests==2.18.4
google-auth==1.1.0

```

And tell pip to install all of the packages in this file using the `-r` flag:

Unix/macOS

```
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt

```

Windows

```
py -m pip install -r requirements.txt

```

## Freezing dependencies [¶](\#freezing-dependencies "Link to this heading")

Pip can export a list of all installed packages and their versions using the
`freeze` command:

Unix/macOS

```
python3 -m pip freeze

```

Windows

```
py -m pip freeze

```

Which will output a list of package specifiers such as:

```
cachetools==2.0.1
certifi==2017.7.27.1
chardet==3.0.4
google-auth==1.1.1
idna==2.6
pyasn1==0.3.6
pyasn1-modules==0.1.4
requests==2.18.4
rsa==3.4.2
six==1.11.0
urllib3==1.22

```

The `pip freeze` command is useful for creating [Requirements Files](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/user_guide/#requirements-files "(in pip v26.0)")
that can re-create the exact versions of all packages installed in an environment.
