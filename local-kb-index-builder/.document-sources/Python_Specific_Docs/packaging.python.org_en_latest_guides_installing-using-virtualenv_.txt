# Installing packages using virtualenv [¶](\#installing-packages-using-virtualenv "Link to this heading")

This guide discusses how to install packages using [pip](../../key_projects/#pip) and
[virtualenv](../../key_projects/#virtualenv), a tool to create isolated Python environments.

Important

This “how to” guide on installing packages and using [virtualenv](../../key_projects/#virtualenv) is
under development. Please refer to the [virtualenv](../../key_projects/#virtualenv) documentation for
details on installation and usage.

Note

This doc uses the term **package** to refer to a
[Distribution Package](../../glossary/#term-Distribution-Package) which is different from an [Import\
Package](../../glossary/#term-Import-Package) that which is used to import modules in your Python source code.
