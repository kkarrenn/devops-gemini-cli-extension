# Tool recommendations [¶](\#tool-recommendations "Link to this heading")

The Python packaging landscape consists of many different tools. For many tasks,
the [Python Packaging Authority](../../glossary/#term-Python-Packaging-Authority-PyPA)
(PyPA, the working group which encompasses many packaging tools and
maintains this guide) purposefully does not make a blanket recommendation; for
example, the reason there are many build backends is that the landscape was
opened up in order to enable the development of new backends serving certain users’
needs better than the previously unique backend, setuptools. This guide does
point to some tools that are widely recognized, and also makes some
recommendations of tools that you should _not_ use because they are deprecated
or insecure.

## Virtual environments [¶](\#virtual-environments "Link to this heading")

The standard tools to create and use virtual environments manually are
[virtualenv](../../key_projects/#virtualenv) (PyPA project) and [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html "(in Python v3.14)") (part of
the Python standard library, though missing some features of virtualenv).

## Installing packages [¶](\#installing-packages "Link to this heading")

[pip](../../key_projects/#pip) is the standard tool to install packages from [PyPI](../../glossary/#term-Python-Package-Index-PyPI). You may want to read pip’s recommendations for
[secure installs](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/topics/secure-installs/ "(in pip v26.0)"). Pip is available by default
in most Python installations through the standard library package
[ensurepip](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ensurepip.html "(in Python v3.14)").

Alternatively, consider [pipx](../../key_projects/#pipx) for the specific use case of installing Python
applications that are distributed through PyPI and run from the command line.
Pipx is a wrapper around pip and venv that installs each
application into a dedicated virtual environment. This avoids conflicts between
the dependencies of different applications, and also with system-wide applications
making use of the same Python interpreter (especially on Linux).

For scientific software specifically, consider [conda](../../key_projects/#conda) or [Spack](../../key_projects/#spack).

Todo

Write a “pip vs. Conda” comparison, here or in a new discussion.

Do **not** use `easy_install` (part of [Setuptools](../../key_projects/#setuptools)), which is deprecated
in favor of pip (see [pip vs easy\_install](../../discussions/pip-vs-easy-install/#pip-vs-easy-install) for details). Likewise, do
**not** use `python setup.py install` or `python setup.py develop`, which
are also deprecated (see [Is setup.py deprecated?](../../discussions/setup-py-deprecated/#setup-py-deprecated) for background and
[How to modernize a setup.py based project?](../modernize-setup-py-project/#modernize-setup-py-project) for migration advice).

## Lock files [¶](\#lock-files "Link to this heading")

[pip-tools](../../key_projects/#pip-tools) and [Pipenv](../../key_projects/#pipenv) are two recognized tools to create lock
files, which contain the exact versions of all packages installed into an
environment, for reproducibility purposes.

## Build backends [¶](\#build-backends "Link to this heading")

Important

Please, remember: this document does not seek to steer the reader towards
a particular tool, only to enumerate common tools. Different use cases often
need specialized workflows.

Popular [build backends](../../glossary/#term-Build-Backend) for pure-Python packages include,
in alphabetical order:

- [Flit-core](https://flit.pypa.io/en/stable/pyproject_toml.html "(in Flit v3.12.0)") – developed with but separate from [flit](../../key_projects/#flit).
  A minimal and opinionated build backend. It does not support plugins.

- [Hatchling](https://pypi.org/project/hatchling/) – developed with but separate from [hatch](../../key_projects/#hatch). Supports plugins.

- [PDM-backend](https://backend.pdm-project.org) – developed with but separate from [pdm](../../key_projects/#pdm). Supports plugins.

- [Poetry-core](https://pypi.org/project/poetry-core/) – developed with but separate from [poetry](../../key_projects/#poetry). Supports
  plugins.

  Unlike other backends on this list, Poetry-core does not support the standard
  [\[project\] table](../writing-pyproject-toml/#writing-pyproject-toml) (it uses a different format,
  in the `[tool.poetry]` table).

- [Setuptools](../../key_projects/#setuptools), which used to be the only build backend. Supports plugins.



  Caution



  If you use setuptools, please be aware that some features that predate
  standardisation efforts are now deprecated and only _temporarily kept_
  for compatibility.



  In particular, do **not** use direct `python setup.py` invocations. On the
  other hand, configuring setuptools with a `setup.py` file is still fully
  supported, although it is recommended to use the modern [\[project\] table\
  in pyproject.toml](../writing-pyproject-toml/#writing-pyproject-toml) (or `setup.cfg`) whenever possible and keep
  `setup.py` only if programmatic configuration is needed. See
  [Is setup.py deprecated?](../../discussions/setup-py-deprecated/#setup-py-deprecated).



  Other examples of deprecated features you should **not** use include the
  `setup_requires` argument to `setup()` (use the [\[build-system\] table](../writing-pyproject-toml/#pyproject-guide-build-system-table) in `pyproject.toml` instead), and
  the `easy_install` command (cf. [pip vs easy\_install](../../discussions/pip-vs-easy-install/#pip-vs-easy-install)).


Do **not** use [distutils](../../key_projects/#distutils), which is deprecated, and has been removed from
the standard library in Python 3.12, although it still remains available from
setuptools.

### Build backends for extension modules [¶](\#build-backends-for-extension-modules "Link to this heading")

For packages with [extension modules](../../glossary/#term-Extension-Module), it is best to use
a build system with dedicated support for the language the extension is written in,
for example:

- [Setuptools](../../key_projects/#setuptools) – natively supports C and C++ (with third-party plugins for Go and Rust),

- [meson-python](../../key_projects/#meson-python) – C, C++, Fortran, Rust, and other languages supported by Meson,

- [scikit-build-core](../../key_projects/#scikit-build-core) – C, C++, Fortran, and other languages supported by CMake,

- [Maturin](../../key_projects/#maturin) – Rust, via Cargo.


## Building distributions [¶](\#building-distributions "Link to this heading")

The standard tool to build [source distributions](../../glossary/#term-Source-Distribution-or-sdist) and [wheels](../../glossary/#term-Wheel) for uploading to PyPI is [build](../../key_projects/#build). It
will invoke whichever build backend you [declared](../writing-pyproject-toml/#pyproject-guide-build-system-table) in `pyproject.toml`.

Do **not** use `python setup.py sdist` and `python setup.py bdist_wheel` for
this task. All direct invocations of `setup.py` are [deprecated](../../discussions/setup-py-deprecated/#setup-py-deprecated).

If you have [extension modules](../../glossary/#term-Extension-Module) and want to distribute
wheels for multiple platforms, use [cibuildwheel](../../key_projects/#cibuildwheel) as part of your CI setup
to build distributable wheels.

## Uploading to PyPI [¶](\#uploading-to-pypi "Link to this heading")

For projects hosted on or published via supported CI/CD platforms, it is
recommended to use the [Trusted Publishing](../publishing-package-distribution-releases-using-github-actions-ci-cd-workflows/#trusted-publishing), which
allows the package to be securely uploaded to PyPI from a CI/CD workflow
without a manually configured API token.

As of November 2024, PyPI supports the following platforms as Trusted Publishing
providers:

- GitHub Actions (on `https://github.com`)

- GitLab CI/CD (on `https://gitlab.com`)

- ActiveState

- Google Cloud


The other available method is to upload the package manually using [twine](../../key_projects/#twine).

Danger

**Never** use `python setup.py upload` for this task. In addition to being
[deprecated](../../discussions/setup-py-deprecated/#setup-py-deprecated), it is insecure.

## Workflow tools [¶](\#workflow-tools "Link to this heading")

These tools are environment managers that automatically manage virtual
environments for a project. They also act as “task runners”, allowing you to
define and invoke tasks such as running tests, compiling documentation,
regenerating some files, etc. Some of them provide shortcuts for building
distributions and uploading to PyPI, and some support lock files for
applications. They often call the tools mentioned above under the hood. In
alphabetical order:

- [flit](../../key_projects/#flit),

- [hatch](../../key_projects/#hatch),

- [nox](https://nox.thea.codes/en/latest/index.html "(in Nox v2025.11.12)"),

- [pdm](../../key_projects/#pdm),

- [Pipenv](../../key_projects/#pipenv),

- [poetry](../../key_projects/#poetry),

- [tox](https://tox.wiki/en/latest/index.html "(in Project name not set v4.34)").
