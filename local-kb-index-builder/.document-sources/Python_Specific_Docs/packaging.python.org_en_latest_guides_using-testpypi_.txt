# Using TestPyPI [¶](\#using-testpypi "Link to this heading")

`TestPyPI` is a separate instance of the [Python Package Index (PyPI)](../../glossary/#term-Python-Package-Index-PyPI)
that allows you to try out the distribution tools and process without worrying
about affecting the real index. TestPyPI is hosted at
[test.pypi.org](https://test.pypi.org)

## Registering your account [¶](\#registering-your-account "Link to this heading")

Because TestPyPI has a separate database from the live PyPI, you’ll need a
separate user account specifically for TestPyPI. Go to
[https://test.pypi.org/account/register/](https://test.pypi.org/account/register/) to register your account.

Note

The database for TestPyPI may be periodically pruned, so it is not
unusual for user accounts to be deleted.

## Using TestPyPI with Twine [¶](\#using-testpypi-with-twine "Link to this heading")

You can upload your distributions to TestPyPI using [twine](../../key_projects/#twine) by specifying
the `--repository` flag:

```
twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*

```

You can see if your package has successfully uploaded by navigating to the URL
`https://test.pypi.org/project/<sampleproject>` where `sampleproject` is
the name of your project that you uploaded. It may take a minute or two for
your project to appear on the site.

## Using TestPyPI with pip [¶](\#using-testpypi-with-pip "Link to this heading")

You can tell [pip](../../key_projects/#pip) to download packages from TestPyPI instead of PyPI by
specifying the `--index-url` flag:

Unix/macOS

```
python3 -m pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ your-package

```

Windows

```
py -m pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ your-package

```

If you want to allow pip to also download packages from PyPI, you can
specify `--extra-index-url` to point to PyPI. This is useful when the package
you’re testing has dependencies:

Unix/macOS

```
python3 -m pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ --extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple/ your-package

```

Windows

```
py -m pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ --extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple/ your-package

```

## Setting up TestPyPI in `.pypirc` [¶](\#setting-up-testpypi-in-pypirc "Link to this heading")

If you want to avoid being prompted for your username and password every time,
you can configure TestPyPI in your `$HOME/.pypirc`:

```
[testpypi]
username = __token__
password = <your TestPyPI API Token>

```

For more details, see the [specification](../../specifications/pypirc/#pypirc) for `.pypirc`.
