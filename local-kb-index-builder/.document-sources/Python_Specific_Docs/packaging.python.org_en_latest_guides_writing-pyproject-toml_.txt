# Writing your `pyproject.toml` [¶](\#writing-your-pyproject-toml "Link to this heading")

`pyproject.toml` is a configuration file used by packaging tools, as
well as other tools such as linters, type checkers, etc. There are
three possible TOML tables in this file.

- The `[build-system]` table is **strongly recommended**. It allows
  you to declare which [build backend](../../glossary/#term-Build-Backend) you use and which other
  dependencies are needed to build your project.

- The `[project]` table is the format that most build backends use to specify
  your project’s basic metadata, such as the dependencies, your name, etc.

- The `[tool]` table has tool-specific subtables, e.g., `[tool.hatch]`,
  `[tool.black]`, `[tool.mypy]`. We only touch upon this table here because
  its contents are defined by each tool. Consult the particular tool’s
  documentation to know what it can contain.


Note

The `[build-system]` table should always be present,
regardless of which build backend you use ( `[build-system]` _defines_ the
build tool you use).

On the other hand, the `[project]` table is understood by _most_ build
backends, but some build backends use a different format.

A notable exception is [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org), which before version 2.0 (released January
5, 2025) did not use the `[project]` table, it used the `[tool.poetry]`
table instead. With version 2.0, it supports both.
Also, the [setuptools](https://setuptools.pypa.io) build backend supports both the `[project]` table,
and the older format in `setup.cfg` or `setup.py`.

For new projects, use the `[project]` table, and keep `setup.py` only if
some programmatic configuration is needed (such as building C extensions),
but the `setup.cfg` and `setup.py` formats are still valid. See
[Is setup.py deprecated?](../../discussions/setup-py-deprecated/#setup-py-deprecated).

## Declaring the build backend [¶](\#declaring-the-build-backend "Link to this heading")

The `[build-system]` table contains a `build-backend` key, which specifies
the build backend to be used. It also contains a `requires` key, which is a
list of dependencies needed to build the project – this is typically just the
build backend package, but it may also contain additional dependencies. You can
also constrain the versions, e.g., `requires = ["setuptools >= 61.0"]`.

Usually, you’ll just copy what your build backend’s documentation
suggests (after [choosing your build backend](../../tutorials/packaging-projects/#choosing-build-backend)).
Here are the values for some common build backends:

Hatchling

```
[build-system]
requires = ["hatchling >= 1.26"]
build-backend = "hatchling.build"

```

setuptools

```
[build-system]
requires = ["setuptools >= 77.0.3"]
build-backend = "setuptools.build_meta"

```

Flit

```
[build-system]
requires = ["flit_core >= 3.12.0, <4"]
build-backend = "flit_core.buildapi"

```

PDM

```
[build-system]
requires = ["pdm-backend >= 2.4.0"]
build-backend = "pdm.backend"

```

uv-build

```
[build-system]
requires = ["uv_build >= 0.9.26, <0.10.0"]
build-backend = "uv_build"

```

## Static vs. dynamic metadata [¶](\#static-vs-dynamic-metadata "Link to this heading")

The rest of this guide is devoted to the `[project]` table.

Most of the time, you will directly write the value of a `[project]`
field. For example: `requires-python = ">= 3.8"`, or `version =
"1.0"`.

However, in some cases, it is useful to let your build backend compute
the metadata for you. For example: many build backends can read the
version from a `__version__` attribute in your code, a Git tag, or
similar. In such cases, you should mark the field as dynamic using, e.g.,

```
[project]
dynamic = ["version"]

```

When a field is dynamic, it is the build backend’s responsibility to
fill it. Consult your build backend’s documentation to learn how it
does it.

## Basic information [¶](\#basic-information "Link to this heading")

### `name` [¶](\#name "Link to this heading")

Put the name of your project on PyPI. This field is required and is the
only field that cannot be marked as dynamic.

```
[project]
name = "spam-eggs"

```

The project name must consist of ASCII letters, digits, underscores “ `_`”,
hyphens “ `-`” and periods “ `.`”. It must not start or end with an
underscore, hyphen or period.

Comparison of project names is case insensitive and treats arbitrarily long runs
of underscores, hyphens, and/or periods as equal. For example, if you register
a project named `cool-stuff`, users will be able to download it or declare a
dependency on it using any of the following spellings: `Cool-Stuff`,
`cool.stuff`, `COOL_STUFF`, `CoOl__-.-__sTuFF`.

### `version` [¶](\#version "Link to this heading")

Put the version of your project.

```
[project]
version = "2020.0.0"

```

Some more complicated version specifiers like `2020.0.0a1` (for an alpha
release) are possible; see the [specification](../../specifications/version-specifiers/#version-specifiers)
for full details.

This field is required, although it is often marked as dynamic using

```
[project]
dynamic = ["version"]

```

This allows use cases such as filling the version from a `__version__`
attribute or a Git tag. Consult the [Single-sourcing the Project Version](../../discussions/single-source-version/#single-source-version)
discussion for more details.

## Dependencies and requirements [¶](\#dependencies-and-requirements "Link to this heading")

### `dependencies`/ `optional-dependencies` [¶](\#dependencies-optional-dependencies "Link to this heading")

If your project has dependencies, list them like this:

```
[project]
dependencies = [
  "httpx",
  "gidgethub[httpx]>4.0.0",
  "django>2.1; os_name != 'nt'",
  "django>2.0; os_name == 'nt'",
]

```

See [Dependency specifiers](../../specifications/dependency-specifiers/#dependency-specifiers) for the full
syntax you can use to constrain versions.

You may want to make some of your dependencies optional, if they are
only needed for a specific feature of your package. In that case, put
them in `optional-dependencies`.

```
[project.optional-dependencies]
gui = ["PyQt5"]
cli = [
  "rich",
  "click",
]

```

Each of the keys defines a “packaging extra”. In the example above, one
could use, e.g., `pip install your-project-name[gui]` to install your
project with GUI support, adding the PyQt5 dependency.

### `requires-python` [¶](\#python-requires "Link to this heading")

This lets you declare the minimum version of Python that you support
[\[1\]](#requires-python-upper-bounds).

```
[project]
requires-python = ">= 3.8"

```

## Creating executable scripts [¶](\#creating-executable-scripts "Link to this heading")

To install a command as part of your package, declare it in the
`[project.scripts]` table.

```
[project.scripts]
spam-cli = "spam:main_cli"

```

In this example, after installing your project, a `spam-cli` command
will be available. Executing this command will do the equivalent of
`import sys; from spam import main_cli; sys.exit(main_cli())`.

On Windows, scripts packaged this way need a terminal, so if you launch
them from within a graphical application, they will make a terminal pop
up. To prevent this from happening, use the `[project.gui-scripts]`
table instead of `[project.scripts]`.

```
[project.gui-scripts]
spam-gui = "spam:main_gui"

```

In that case, launching your script from the command line will give back
control immediately, leaving the script to run in the background.

The difference between `[project.scripts]` and
`[project.gui-scripts]` is only relevant on Windows.

## About your project [¶](\#about-your-project "Link to this heading")

### `authors`/ `maintainers` [¶](\#authors-maintainers "Link to this heading")

Both of these fields contain lists of people identified by a name and/or
an email address.

```
[project]
authors = [
  {name = "Pradyun Gedam", email = "pradyun@example.com"},
  {name = "Tzu-Ping Chung", email = "tzu-ping@example.com"},
  {name = "Another person"},
  {email = "different.person@example.com"},
]
maintainers = [
  {name = "Brett Cannon", email = "brett@example.com"}
]

```

### `description` [¶](\#description "Link to this heading")

This should be a one-line description of your project, to show as the “headline”
of your project page on PyPI ( [example](https://pypi.org/project/pip)), and other places such as
lists of search results ( [example](https://pypi.org/search?q=pip)).

```
[project]
description = "Lovely Spam! Wonderful Spam!"

```

### `readme` [¶](\#readme "Link to this heading")

This is a longer description of your project, to display on your project
page on PyPI. Typically, your project will have a `README.md` or
`README.rst` file and you just put its file name here.

```
[project]
readme = "README.md"

```

The README’s format is auto-detected from the extension:

- `README.md` → [GitHub-flavored Markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax),

- `README.rst` → [reStructuredText](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html) (without Sphinx extensions).


You can also specify the format explicitly, like this:

```
[project]
readme = {file = "README.txt", content-type = "text/markdown"}
# or
readme = {file = "README.txt", content-type = "text/x-rst"}

```

### `license` and `license-files` [¶](\#license-and-license-files "Link to this heading")

As per [**PEP 639**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0639/), licenses should be declared with two fields:

- `license` is an [SPDX license expression](../../glossary/#term-License-Expression)
  consisting of one or more [license identifiers](../../glossary/#term-License-Identifier).

- `license-files` is a list of license file glob patterns.


A previous PEP had specified `license` to be a table with a `file` or a
`text` key, this format is now deprecated. Most [build backends](../../glossary/#term-Build-Backend) now support the new format as shown in the following table.

build backend versions that introduced [**PEP 639**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0639/) support [¶](#id9 "Link to this table")

hatchling

setuptools

flit-core [\[2\]](#flit-core-pep639)

pdm-backend

poetry-core

uv-build

1.27.0

77.0.3

3.12

2.4.0

2.2.0

0.7.19

#### `license` [¶](\#license "Link to this heading")

The new format for `license` is a valid [SPDX license expression](../../glossary/#term-License-Expression)
consisting of one or more [license identifiers](../../glossary/#term-License-Identifier).
The full license list is available at the
[SPDX license list page](https://spdx.org/licenses/). The supported list version is
3.17 or any later compatible one.

```
[project]
license = "GPL-3.0-or-later"
# or
license = "MIT AND (Apache-2.0 OR BSD-2-Clause)"

```

Note

If you get a build error that `license` should be a dict/table,
your build backend doesn’t yet support the new format. See the
[above section](#license-and-license-files) for more context.
The now deprecated format is [described in PEP 621](https://peps.python.org/pep-0621/#license).

As a general rule, it is a good idea to use a standard, well-known
license, both to avoid confusion and because some organizations avoid software
whose license is unapproved.

If your [Distribution Archive](../../glossary/#term-Distribution-Archive) is licensed with a license that doesn’t
have an existing SPDX identifier, you can create a custom one in format
`LicenseRef-[idstring]`. The custom identifiers must follow the SPDX
specification, [clause 10.1](https://spdx.github.io/spdx-spec/v2.2.2/other-licensing-information-detected/) of the version 2.2 or any later
compatible one.

```
[project]
license = "LicenseRef-My-Custom-License"

```

#### `license-files` [¶](\#license-files "Link to this heading")

This is a list of license files and files containing other legal
information you want to distribute with your package.

```
[project]
license-files = ["LICEN[CS]E*", "vendored/licenses/*.txt", "AUTHORS.md"]

```

The glob patterns must follow the specification:

- Alphanumeric characters, underscores ( `_`), hyphens ( `-`) and dots ( `.`)
  will be matched verbatim.

- Special characters: `*`, `?`, `**` and character ranges: \[\] are supported.

- Path delimiters must be the forward slash character ( `/`).

- Patterns are relative to the directory containing `pyproject.toml`, and
  thus may not start with a slash character.

- Parent directory indicators ( `..`) must not be used.

- Each glob must match at least one file.


Literal paths are valid globs.
Any characters or character sequences not covered by this specification are
invalid.

### `keywords` [¶](\#keywords "Link to this heading")

This will help PyPI’s search box to suggest your project when people
search for these keywords.

```
[project]
keywords = ["egg", "bacon", "sausage", "tomatoes", "Lobster Thermidor"]

```

### `classifiers` [¶](\#classifiers "Link to this heading")

A list of PyPI classifiers that apply to your project. Check the
[full list of possibilities](https://pypi.org/classifiers).

```
classifiers = [
  # How mature is this project? Common values are
  #   3 - Alpha
  #   4 - Beta
  #   5 - Production/Stable
  "Development Status :: 4 - Beta",

  # Indicate who your project is intended for
  "Intended Audience :: Developers",
  "Topic :: Software Development :: Build Tools",

  # Specify the Python versions you support here.
  "Programming Language :: Python :: 3",
  "Programming Language :: Python :: 3.6",
  "Programming Language :: Python :: 3.7",
  "Programming Language :: Python :: 3.8",
  "Programming Language :: Python :: 3.9",
]

```

Although the list of classifiers is often used to declare what Python versions a
project supports, this information is only used for searching and browsing
projects on PyPI, not for installing projects. To actually restrict what Python
versions a project can be installed on, use the [requires-python](#requires-python) argument.

To prevent a package from being uploaded to PyPI, use the special `Private ::
Do Not Upload` classifier. PyPI will always reject packages with classifiers
beginning with `Private ::`.

### `urls` [¶](\#urls "Link to this heading")

A list of URLs associated with your project, displayed on the left
sidebar of your PyPI project page.

Note

See [Well-known labels](../../specifications/well-known-project-urls/#well-known-labels) for a listing
of labels that PyPI and other packaging tools are specifically aware of,
and [PyPI’s project metadata docs](https://docs.pypi.org/project_metadata/#project-urls)
for PyPI-specific URL processing.

```
[project.urls]
Homepage = "https://example.com"
Documentation = "https://readthedocs.org"
Repository = "https://github.com/me/spam.git"
Issues = "https://github.com/me/spam/issues"
Changelog = "https://github.com/me/spam/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md"

```

Note that if the label contains spaces, it needs to be quoted, e.g.,
`Website = "https://example.com"` but
`"Official Website" = "https://example.com"`.

Users are advised to use [Well-known labels](../../specifications/well-known-project-urls/#well-known-labels) for their project URLs
where appropriate, since consumers of metadata (like package indices) can
specialize their presentation.

For example in the following metadata, neither `MyHomepage` nor
`"Download Link"` is a well-known label, so they will be rendered verbatim:

```
[project.urls]
MyHomepage = "https://example.com"
"Download Link" = "https://example.com/abc.tar.gz"

```

Whereas in this metadata `HomePage` and `DOWNLOAD` both have
well-known equivalents ( `homepage` and `download`), and can be presented
with those semantics in mind (the project’s home page and its external
download location, respectively).

```
[project.urls]
HomePage = "https://example.com"
DOWNLOAD = "https://example.com/abc.tar.gz"

```

## Advanced plugins [¶](\#advanced-plugins "Link to this heading")

Some packages can be extended through plugins. Examples include [Pytest](https://pytest.org)
and [Pygments](https://pygments.org). To create such a plugin, you need to declare it in a subtable
of `[project.entry-points]` like this:

```
[project.entry-points."spam.magical"]
tomatoes = "spam:main_tomatoes"

```

See the [Plugin guide](../creating-and-discovering-plugins/#plugin-entry-points) for more information.
