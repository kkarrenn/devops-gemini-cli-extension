# Overview of Python Packaging [¶](\#overview-of-python-packaging "Link to this heading")

As a general-purpose programming language, Python is designed to be
used in many ways. You can build web sites or industrial robots or a
game for your friends to play, and much more, all using the same
core technology.

Python’s flexibility is why the first step in every Python project
must be to think about the project’s audience and the corresponding
environment where the project will run. It might seem strange to think
about packaging before writing code, but this process does wonders for
avoiding future headaches.

This overview provides a general-purpose decision tree for reasoning
about Python’s plethora of packaging options. Read on to choose the best
technology for your next project.

## Thinking about deployment [¶](\#thinking-about-deployment "Link to this heading")

Packages exist to be installed (or _deployed_), so before you package
anything, you’ll want to have some answers to the deployment questions
below:

- Who are your software’s users? Will your software be installed by
  other developers doing software development, operations people in a
  datacenter, or a less software-savvy group?

- Is your software intended to run on servers, desktops, mobile
  clients (phones, tablets, etc.), or embedded in dedicated devices?

- Is your software installed individually, or in large deployment batches?


Packaging is all about target environment and deployment
experience. There are many answers to the questions above and each
combination of circumstances has its own solutions. With this
information, the following overview will guide you to the packaging
technologies best suited to your project.

## Packaging Python libraries and tools [¶](\#packaging-python-libraries-and-tools "Link to this heading")

You may have heard about PyPI, `setup.py`, and `wheel`
files. These are just a few of the tools Python’s ecosystem provides
for distributing Python code to developers, which you can read about in
[Packaging and distributing projects](../guides/distributing-packages-using-setuptools/).

The following approaches to packaging are meant for libraries and
tools used by technical audience in a development setting. If you’re
looking for ways to package Python for a non-technical audience and/or
a production setting, skip ahead to [Packaging Python applications](#packaging-applications).

### Python modules [¶](\#python-modules "Link to this heading")

A Python file, provided it only relies on the standard library, can be
redistributed and reused. You will also need to ensure it’s written
for the right version of Python, and only relies on the standard
library.

This is great for sharing simple scripts and snippets between people
who both have compatible Python versions (such as via email,
StackOverflow, or GitHub gists). There are even some entire Python
libraries that offer this as an option, such as
[bottle.py](https://bottlepy.org/docs/dev/tutorial.html "(in Bottle v0.14)") and [boltons](https://boltons.readthedocs.io/en/latest/architecture.html "(in boltons v25.0)").

However, this pattern won’t scale for projects that consist of
multiple files, need additional libraries, or need a specific version
of Python, hence the options below.

### Python source distributions [¶](\#python-source-distributions "Link to this heading")

If your code consists of multiple Python files, it’s usually organized
into a directory structure. Any directory containing Python files can
comprise an [Import Package](../glossary/#term-Import-Package).

Because packages consist of multiple files, they are harder to
distribute. Most protocols support transferring only one file at a
time (when was the last time you clicked a link and it downloaded
multiple files?). It’s easier to get incomplete transfers, and harder
to guarantee code integrity at the destination.

So long as your code contains nothing but pure Python code, and you
know your deployment environment supports your version of Python, then
you can use Python’s native packaging tools to create a _source_ [Distribution Package](../glossary/#term-Distribution-Package), or _sdist_ for short.

Python’s _sdists_ are compressed archives ( `.tar.gz` files)
containing one or more packages or modules. If your code is
pure-Python, and you only depend on other Python packages, you can
go to the [Source distribution format](../specifications/source-distribution-format/#source-distribution-format) specification to learn more.

If you rely on any non-Python code, or non-Python packages (such as
[libxml2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libxml2) in the case of
[lxml](https://pypi.org/project/lxml/), or BLAS libraries in the
case of [numpy](https://pypi.org/project/numpy)), you will need to
use the format detailed in the next section, which also has many
advantages for pure-Python libraries.

Note

Python and PyPI support multiple distributions providing
different implementations of the same package. For instance the
unmaintained-but-seminal [PIL distribution](https://pypi.org/project/PIL/) provides the PIL package, and so
does [Pillow](https://pypi.org/project/Pillow/), an
actively-maintained fork of PIL!

This Python packaging superpower makes it possible for Pillow to be
a drop-in replacement for PIL, just by changing your project’s
`install_requires` or `requirements.txt`.

### Python binary distributions [¶](\#python-binary-distributions "Link to this heading")

So much of Python’s practical power comes from its ability to
integrate with the software ecosystem, in particular libraries written
in C, C++, Fortran, Rust, and other languages.

Not all developers have the right tools or experiences to build these
components written in these compiled languages, so Python created the
[Wheel](../glossary/#term-Wheel), a package format designed to ship libraries with
compiled artifacts. In fact, Python’s package installer, `pip`,
always prefers wheels because installation is always faster, so even
pure-Python packages work better with wheels.

Binary distributions are best when they come with source distributions
to match. Even if you don’t upload wheels of your code for every
operating system, by uploading the sdist, you’re enabling users of
other platforms to still build it for themselves. Default to
publishing both sdist and wheel archives together, _unless_ you’re
creating artifacts for a very specific use case where you know the
recipient only needs one or the other.

Python and PyPI make it easy to upload both wheels and sdists
together. Just follow the [Packaging Python Projects](../tutorials/packaging-projects/)
tutorial.

technologies. Excerpted from [The Packaging Gradient (2017)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLVNWfPWAC8). [¶](#id2 "Link to this image")

## Packaging Python applications [¶](\#packaging-python-applications "Link to this heading")

So far we’ve only discussed Python’s native distribution tools. Based
on our introduction, you would be correct to infer these built-in
approaches only target environments which have Python, and an
audience who knows how to install Python packages.

With the variety of operating systems, configurations, and people out
there, this assumption is only safe when targeting a developer
audience.

Python’s native packaging is mostly built for distributing reusable
code, called libraries, between developers. You can piggyback
**tools**, or basic applications for developers, on top of Python’s
library packaging, using technologies like
[setuptools entry\_points](https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/entry_point.html "(in setuptools v80.10.0)").

Libraries are building blocks, not complete applications. For
distributing applications, there’s a whole new world of technologies
out there.

The next few sections organize these application packaging options
according to their dependencies on the target environment,
so you can choose the right one for your project.

### Depending on a framework [¶](\#depending-on-a-framework "Link to this heading")

Some types of Python applications, like web site backends and other
network services, are common enough that they have frameworks to
enable their development and packaging. Other types of applications,
like dynamic web frontends and mobile clients, are complex enough to
target that a framework becomes more than a convenience.

In all these cases, it makes sense to work backwards, from the
framework’s packaging and deployment story. Some frameworks include a
deployment system which wraps the technologies outlined in the rest of
the guide. In these cases, you’ll want to defer to your framework’s
packaging guide for the easiest and most reliable production experience.

If you ever wonder how these platforms and frameworks work under the
hood, you can always read the sections beyond.

#### Service platforms [¶](\#service-platforms "Link to this heading")

If you’re developing for a
“ [Platform-as-a-Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_as_a_service)”
or “PaaS”, you are going to want to follow their respective packaging
guides. These types of platforms take care of packaging and deployment,
as long as you follow their patterns. Most software does not fit one of
these templates, hence the existence of all the other options below.

If you’re developing software that will be deployed to machines you
own, users’ personal computers, or any other arrangement, read on.

#### Web browsers and mobile applications [¶](\#web-browsers-and-mobile-applications "Link to this heading")

Python’s steady advances are leading it into new spaces. These days
you can write a mobile app or web application frontend in
Python. While the language may be familiar, the packaging and
deployment practices are brand new.

If you’re planning on releasing to these new frontiers, you’ll want to
check out the following frameworks, and refer to their packaging
guides:

- [Kivy](https://kivy.org/)

- [Beeware](https://pybee.org/)

- [Brython](https://brython.info/)

- [Flexx](https://flexx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)


If you are _not_ interested in using a framework or platform, or just
wonder about some of the technologies and techniques utilized by the
frameworks above, continue reading below.

### Depending on a pre-installed Python [¶](\#depending-on-a-pre-installed-python "Link to this heading")

Pick an arbitrary computer, and depending on the context, there’s a very
good chance Python is already installed. Included by default in most
Linux and Mac operating systems for many years now, you can reasonably
depend on Python preexisting in your data centers or on the personal
machines of developers and data scientists.

Technologies which support this model:

- [PEX](https://github.com/pantsbuild/pex#user-content-pex) (Python EXecutable)

- [zipapp](https://docs.python.org/3/library/zipapp.html "(in Python v3.14)") (does not help manage dependencies, requires Python 3.5+)

- [shiv](https://github.com/linkedin/shiv#user-content-shiv) (requires Python 3)


Note

Of all the approaches here, depending on a pre-installed
Python relies the most on the target environment. Of course,
this also makes for the smallest package, as small as
single-digit megabytes, or even kilobytes.

In general, decreasing the dependency on the target system
increases the size of our package, so the solutions here
are roughly arranged by increasing size of output.

### Depending on a separate software distribution ecosystem [¶](\#depending-on-a-separate-software-distribution-ecosystem "Link to this heading")

For a long time many operating systems, including Mac and Windows,
lacked built-in package management. Only recently did these OSes gain
so-called “app stores”, but even those focus on consumer applications
and offer little for developers.

Developers long sought remedies, and in this struggle, emerged with
their own package management solutions, such as [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/). The most relevant alternative for Python
developers is a package ecosystem called [Anaconda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaconda_(Python_distribution)). Anaconda
is built around Python and is increasingly common in academic,
analytical, and other data-oriented environments, even making its way
[into server-oriented environments](https://web.archive.org/web/20190403064038/https://www.paypal-engineering.com/2016/09/07/python-packaging-at-paypal/).

Instructions on building and publishing for the Anaconda ecosystem:

- [Building libraries and applications with conda](https://conda.io/projects/conda-build/en/latest/user-guide/tutorials/index.html)

- [Transitioning a native Python package to Anaconda](https://conda.io/projects/conda-build/en/latest/user-guide/tutorials/build-pkgs-skeleton.html)


A similar model involves installing an alternative Python
distribution, but does not support arbitrary operating system-level
packages:

- [ActiveState ActivePython](https://www.activestate.com/products/python/)

- [WinPython](http://winpython.github.io/)


### Bringing your own Python executable [¶](\#bringing-your-own-python-executable "Link to this heading")

Computing as we know it is defined by the ability to execute
programs. Every operating system natively supports one or more formats
of programs they can natively execute.

There are many techniques and technologies which turn your Python
program into one of these formats, most of which involve embedding the
Python interpreter and any other dependencies into a single executable
file.

This approach, called _freezing_, offers wide compatibility and
seamless user experience, though often requires multiple technologies,
and a good amount of effort.

A selection of Python freezers:

- [pyInstaller](https://pyinstaller.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) \- Cross-platform

- [cx\_Freeze](https://marcelotduarte.github.io/cx_Freeze/) \- Cross-platform

- [constructor](https://github.com/conda/constructor) \- For command-line installers

- [py2exe](http://www.py2exe.org/) \- Windows only

- [py2app](https://py2app.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) \- Mac only

- [osnap](https://github.com/jamesabel/osnap) \- Windows and Mac

- [pynsist](https://pypi.org/project/pynsist/) \- Windows only


Most of the above imply single-user deployments. For multi-component
server applications, see [Chef Omnibus](https://github.com/chef/omnibus#user-content--omnibus).

### Bringing your own userspace [¶](\#bringing-your-own-userspace "Link to this heading")

An increasing number of operating systems – including Linux, Mac OS,
and Windows – can be set up to run applications packaged as
lightweight images, using a relatively modern arrangement often
referred to as [operating-system-level virtualization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating-system-level_virtualization),
or _containerization_.

These techniques are mostly Python agnostic, because they package
whole OS filesystems, not just Python or Python packages.

Adoption is most extensive among Linux servers, where the technology
originated and where the technologies below work best:

- [AppImage](https://appimage.org/)

- [Docker](https://www.fullstackpython.com/docker.html)

- [Flatpak](https://flatpak.org/)

- [Snapcraft](https://snapcraft.io/)


### Bringing your own kernel [¶](\#bringing-your-own-kernel "Link to this heading")

Most desktop operating systems support some form of classical virtualization,
running applications packaged as images containing a full operating
system of their own. Running these virtual machines, or VMs, is a
mature approach, widespread in data center environments.

These techniques are mostly reserved for larger scale deployments in
data centers, though certain complex applications can benefit from
this packaging. The technologies are Python agnostic, and include:

- KVM on Linux

- Hyper-V on Windows

- [VHD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VHD_(file_format)),
  [AMI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Machine_Image),
  and [other formats](https://docs.openstack.org/glance/latest/user/formats.html "(in glance v31.0.0.0b3.dev16)")

- [OpenStack](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/openstack) -
  A cloud management system written in Python, with extensive VM support


### Bringing your own hardware [¶](\#bringing-your-own-hardware "Link to this heading")

The most all-encompassing way to ship your software would be to ship
it already-installed on some hardware. This way, your software’s user
would require only electricity.

Whereas the virtual machines described above are primarily reserved
for the tech-savvy, you can find hardware appliances being used by
everyone from the most advanced data centers to the youngest children.

Embed your code on an [Adafruit](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython),
[MicroPython](https://micropython.org/), or more-powerful hardware
running Python, then ship it to the datacenter or your users’
homes. They plug and play, and you can call it a day.

## What about… [¶](\#what-about "Link to this heading")

The sections above can only summarize so much, and you might be
wondering about some of the more conspicuous gaps.

### Operating system packages [¶](\#operating-system-packages "Link to this heading")

As mentioned in [Depending on a separate software distribution ecosystem](#depending-on-a-separate-ecosystem) above, some operating
systems have package managers of their own. If you’re very sure of the
operating system you’re targeting, you can depend directly on a format
like [deb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deb_(file_format)) (for
Debian, Ubuntu, etc.) or [RPM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RPM_Package_Manager) (for Red Hat,
Fedora, etc.), and use that built-in package manager to take care of
installation, and even deployment. You can even use [FPM](https://fpm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cli-reference.html#virtualenv) to
generate both deb and RPMs from the same source.

In most deployment pipelines, the OS package manager is just one piece
of the puzzle.

### virtualenv [¶](\#virtualenv "Link to this heading")

[Virtualenvs](https://docs.python-guide.org/dev/virtualenvs/ "(in pythonguide v0.0.1)") have
been an indispensable tool for multiple generations of Python
developer, but are slowly fading from view, as they are being wrapped
by higher-level tools. With packaging in particular, virtualenvs are
used as a primitive in [the dh-virtualenv tool](https://dh-virtualenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial.html "(in dh_virtualenv v1.2)") and
[osnap](https://github.com/jamesabel/osnap), both of which wrap
virtualenvs in a self-contained way.

For production deployments, do not rely on running `python -m pip install`
from the Internet into a virtualenv, as one might do in a development
environment. The overview above is full of much better solutions.

### Security [¶](\#security "Link to this heading")

The further down the gradient you come, the harder it gets to update
components of your package. Everything is more tightly bound together.

For example, if a kernel security issue emerges, and you’re deploying
containers, the host system’s kernel can be updated without requiring
a new build on behalf of the application. If you deploy VM images,
you’ll need a new build. Whether or not this dynamic makes one option
more secure is still a bit of an old debate, going back to the
still-unsettled matter of [static versus dynamic linking](https://www.google.com/search?channel=fs&q=static+vs+dynamic+linking).

## Wrap up [¶](\#wrap-up "Link to this heading")

Packaging in Python has a bit of a reputation for being a bumpy
ride. This impression is mostly a byproduct of Python’s
versatility. Once you understand the natural boundaries between each
packaging solution, you begin to realize that the varied landscape is
a small price Python programmers pay for using one of the most
balanced, flexible languages available.
