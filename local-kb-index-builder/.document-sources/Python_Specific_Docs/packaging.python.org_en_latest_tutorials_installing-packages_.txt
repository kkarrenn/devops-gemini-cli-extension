# Installing Packages [¶](\#installing-packages "Link to this heading")

This section covers the basics of how to install Python [packages](../../glossary/#term-Distribution-Package).

It’s important to note that the term “package” in this context is being used to
describe a bundle of software to be installed (i.e. as a synonym for a
[distribution](../../glossary/#term-Distribution-Package)). It does not refer to the kind
of [package](../../glossary/#term-Import-Package) that you import in your Python source code
(i.e. a container of modules). It is common in the Python community to refer to
a [distribution](../../glossary/#term-Distribution-Package) using the term “package”. Using
the term “distribution” is often not preferred, because it can easily be
confused with a Linux distribution, or another larger software distribution
like Python itself.

## Requirements for Installing Packages [¶](\#requirements-for-installing-packages "Link to this heading")

This section describes the steps to follow before installing other Python
packages.

### Ensure you can run Python from the command line [¶](\#ensure-you-can-run-python-from-the-command-line "Link to this heading")

Before you go any further, make sure you have Python and that the expected
version is available from your command line. You can check this by running:

Unix/macOS

```
python3 --version

```

Windows

```
py --version

```

You should get some output like `Python 3.6.3`. If you do not have Python,
please install the latest 3.x version from [python.org](https://www.python.org) or refer to the
[Installing Python](https://docs.python-guide.org/starting/installation/#installation "(in pythonguide v0.0.1)") section of the Hitchhiker’s Guide to Python.

Note

If you’re a newcomer and you get an error like this:

```
>>> python3 --version
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
NameError: name 'python3' is not defined

```

It’s because this command and other suggested commands in this tutorial
are intended to be run in a _shell_ (also called a _terminal_ or
_console_). See the Python for Beginners [getting started tutorial](https://opentechschool.github.io/python-beginners/en/getting_started.html#what-is-python-exactly) for
an introduction to using your operating system’s shell and interacting with
Python.

Note

If you’re using an enhanced shell like IPython or the Jupyter
notebook, you can run system commands like those in this tutorial by
prefacing them with a `!` character:

```
In [1]: import sys
        !{sys.executable} --version
Python 3.6.3

```

It’s recommended to write `{sys.executable}` rather than plain `python` in
order to ensure that commands are run in the Python installation matching
the currently running notebook (which may not be the same Python
installation that the `python` command refers to).

Note

Due to the way most Linux distributions are handling the Python 3
migration, Linux users using the system Python without creating a virtual
environment first should replace the `python` command in this tutorial
with `python3` and the `python -m pip` command with `python3 -m pip --user`. Do _not_
run any of the commands in this tutorial with `sudo`: if you get a
permissions error, come back to the section on creating virtual environments,
set one up, and then continue with the tutorial as written.

### Ensure you can run pip from the command line [¶](\#ensure-you-can-run-pip-from-the-command-line "Link to this heading")

Additionally, you’ll need to make sure you have [pip](../../key_projects/#pip) available. You can
check this by running:

Unix/macOS

```
python3 -m pip --version

```

Windows

```
py -m pip --version

```

If you installed Python from source, with an installer from [python.org](https://www.python.org), or
via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) you should already have pip. If you’re on Linux and installed
using your OS package manager, you may have to install pip separately, see
[Installing pip/setuptools/wheel with Linux Package Managers](../../guides/installing-using-linux-tools/).

If `pip` isn’t already installed, then first try to bootstrap it from the
standard library:

Unix/macOS

```
python3 -m ensurepip --default-pip

```

Windows

```
py -m ensurepip --default-pip

```

If that still doesn’t allow you to run `python -m pip`:

- Securely Download [get-pip.py](https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py) [\[1\]](#id7)

- Run `python get-pip.py`. [\[2\]](#id8) This will install or upgrade pip.
  Additionally, it will install [Setuptools](../../key_projects/#setuptools) and [wheel](../../key_projects/#wheel) if they’re
  not installed already.



  Warning



  Be cautious if you’re using a Python install that’s managed by your
  operating system or another package manager. get-pip.py does not
  coordinate with those tools, and may leave your system in an
  inconsistent state. You can use `python get-pip.py --prefix=/usr/local/`
  to install in `/usr/local` which is designed for locally-installed
  software.


### Ensure pip, setuptools, and wheel are up to date [¶](\#ensure-pip-setuptools-and-wheel-are-up-to-date "Link to this heading")

While `pip` alone is sufficient to install from pre-built binary archives,
up to date copies of the `setuptools` and `wheel` projects are useful
to ensure you can also install from source archives:

Unix/macOS

```
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel

```

Windows

```
py -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel

```

### Optionally, create a virtual environment [¶](\#optionally-create-a-virtual-environment "Link to this heading")

See [section below](#creating-and-using-virtual-environments) for details,
but here’s the basic [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html "(in Python v3.14)") [\[3\]](#id9) command to use on a typical Linux system:

Unix/macOS

```
python3 -m venv tutorial_env
source tutorial_env/bin/activate

```

Windows

```
py -m venv tutorial_env
tutorial_env\Scripts\activate

```

This will create a new virtual environment in the `tutorial_env` subdirectory,
and configure the current shell to use it as the default `python` environment.

## Creating Virtual Environments [¶](\#creating-virtual-environments "Link to this heading")

Python “Virtual Environments” allow Python [packages](../../glossary/#term-Distribution-Package) to be installed in an isolated location for a particular application,
rather than being installed globally. If you are looking to safely install
global command line tools,
see [Installing stand alone command line tools](../../guides/installing-stand-alone-command-line-tools/).

Imagine you have an application that needs version 1 of LibFoo, but another
application requires version 2. How can you use both these applications? If you
install everything into /usr/lib/python3.6/site-packages (or whatever your
platform’s standard location is), it’s easy to end up in a situation where you
unintentionally upgrade an application that shouldn’t be upgraded.

Or more generally, what if you want to install an application and leave it be?
If an application works, any change in its libraries or the versions of those
libraries can break the application.

Also, what if you can’t install [packages](../../glossary/#term-Distribution-Package) into the
global site-packages directory? For instance, on a shared host.

In all these cases, virtual environments can help you. They have their own
installation directories and they don’t share libraries with other virtual
environments.

Currently, there are two common tools for creating Python virtual environments:

- [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html "(in Python v3.14)") is available by default in Python 3.3 and later, and installs
  [pip](../../key_projects/#pip) into created virtual environments in Python 3.4 and later
  (Python versions prior to 3.12 also installed [Setuptools](../../key_projects/#setuptools)).

- [virtualenv](../../key_projects/#virtualenv) needs to be installed separately, but supports Python 2.7+
  and Python 3.3+, and [pip](../../key_projects/#pip), [Setuptools](../../key_projects/#setuptools) and [wheel](../../key_projects/#wheel) are
  installed into created virtual environments by default. Note that `setuptools` is no longer
  included by default starting with Python 3.12 (and `virtualenv` follows this behavior).


The basic usage is like so:

Using [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html "(in Python v3.14)"):

Unix/macOS

```
python3 -m venv <DIR>
source <DIR>/bin/activate

```

Windows

```
py -m venv <DIR>
<DIR>\Scripts\activate

```

Using [virtualenv](../../key_projects/#virtualenv):

Unix/macOS

```
python3 -m virtualenv <DIR>
source <DIR>/bin/activate

```

Windows

```
virtualenv <DIR>
<DIR>\Scripts\activate

```

For more information, see the [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html "(in Python v3.14)") docs or
the [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/index.html "(in virtualenv v0.1)") docs.

The use of **source** under Unix shells ensures
that the virtual environment’s variables are set within the current
shell, and not in a subprocess (which then disappears, having no
useful effect).

In both of the above cases, Windows users should _not_ use the
**source** command, but should rather run the **activate**
script directly from the command shell like so:

```
<DIR>\Scripts\activate

```

Managing multiple virtual environments directly can become tedious, so the
[dependency management tutorial](../managing-dependencies/#managing-dependencies) introduces a
higher level tool, [Pipenv](../../key_projects/#pipenv), that automatically manages a separate
virtual environment for each project and application that you work on.

## Use pip for Installing [¶](\#use-pip-for-installing "Link to this heading")

[pip](../../key_projects/#pip) is the recommended installer. Below, we’ll cover the most common
usage scenarios. For more detail, see the [pip docs](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/ "(in pip v26.0)"),
which includes a complete [Reference Guide](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/cli/ "(in pip v26.0)").

## Installing from PyPI [¶](\#installing-from-pypi "Link to this heading")

The most common usage of [pip](../../key_projects/#pip) is to install from the [Python Package\
Index](../../glossary/#term-Python-Package-Index-PyPI) using a [requirement specifier](../../glossary/#term-Requirement-Specifier). Generally speaking, a requirement specifier is
composed of a project name followed by an optional [version specifier](../../glossary/#term-Version-Specifier). A full description of the supported specifiers can be
found in the [Version specifier specification](../../specifications/version-specifiers/#version-specifiers).
Below are some examples.

To install the latest version of “SomeProject”:

Unix/macOS

```
python3 -m pip install "SomeProject"

```

Windows

```
py -m pip install "SomeProject"

```

To install a specific version:

Unix/macOS

```
python3 -m pip install "SomeProject==1.4"

```

Windows

```
py -m pip install "SomeProject==1.4"

```

To install greater than or equal to one version and less than another:

Unix/macOS

```
python3 -m pip install "SomeProject>=1,<2"

```

Windows

```
py -m pip install "SomeProject>=1,<2"

```

To install a version that’s [compatible](../../specifications/version-specifiers/#version-specifiers-compatible-release)
with a certain version: [\[4\]](#id10)

Unix/macOS

```
python3 -m pip install "SomeProject~=1.4.2"

```

Windows

```
py -m pip install "SomeProject~=1.4.2"

```

In this case, this means to install any version “==1.4.\*” version that’s also
“>=1.4.2”.

## Source Distributions vs Wheels [¶](\#source-distributions-vs-wheels "Link to this heading")

[pip](../../key_projects/#pip) can install from either [Source Distributions (sdist)](../../glossary/#term-Source-Distribution-or-sdist) or [Wheels](../../glossary/#term-Wheel), but if both are present
on PyPI, pip will prefer a compatible [wheel](../../glossary/#term-Wheel). You can override
pip\`s default behavior by e.g. using its [–no-binary](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/cli/pip_install/#install-no-binary "(in pip v26.0)") option.

[Wheels](../../glossary/#term-Wheel) are a pre-built [distribution](../../glossary/#term-Distribution-Package) format that provides faster installation compared to [Source\
Distributions (sdist)](../../glossary/#term-Source-Distribution-or-sdist), especially when a
project contains compiled extensions.

If [pip](../../key_projects/#pip) does not find a wheel to install, it will locally build a wheel
and cache it for future installs, instead of rebuilding the source distribution
in the future.

## Upgrading packages [¶](\#upgrading-packages "Link to this heading")

Upgrade an already installed `SomeProject` to the latest from PyPI.

Unix/macOS

```
python3 -m pip install --upgrade SomeProject

```

Windows

```
py -m pip install --upgrade SomeProject

```

## Installing to the User Site [¶](\#installing-to-the-user-site "Link to this heading")

To install [packages](../../glossary/#term-Distribution-Package) that are isolated to the
current user, use the `--user` flag:

Unix/macOS

```
python3 -m pip install --user SomeProject

```

Windows

```
py -m pip install --user SomeProject

```

For more information see the [User Installs](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/user_guide/#user-installs) section
from the pip docs.

Note that the `--user` flag has no effect when inside a virtual environment
\- all installation commands will affect the virtual environment.

If `SomeProject` defines any command-line scripts or console entry points,
`--user` will cause them to be installed inside the [user base](https://docs.python.org/3/library/site.html#site.USER_BASE)’s binary
directory, which may or may not already be present in your shell’s
`PATH`. (Starting in version 10, pip displays a warning when
installing any scripts to a directory outside `PATH`.) If the scripts
are not available in your shell after installation, you’ll need to add the
directory to your `PATH`:

- On Linux and macOS you can find the user base binary directory by running
  `python -m site --user-base` and adding `bin` to the end. For example,
  this will typically print `~/.local` (with `~` expanded to the absolute
  path to your home directory) so you’ll need to add `~/.local/bin` to your
  `PATH`. You can set your `PATH` permanently by [modifying ~/.profile](https://stackoverflow.com/a/14638025).

- On Windows you can find the user base binary directory by running `py -m
  site --user-site` and replacing `site-packages` with `Scripts`. For
  example, this could return
  `C:\Users\Username\AppData\Roaming\Python36\site-packages` so you would
  need to set your `PATH` to include
  `C:\Users\Username\AppData\Roaming\Python36\Scripts`. You can set your user
  `PATH` permanently in the [Control Panel](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/shell/user-environment-variables?redirectedfrom=MSDN). You may need to log out for the
  `PATH` changes to take effect.


## Requirements files [¶](\#requirements-files "Link to this heading")

Install a list of requirements specified in a [Requirements File](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/user_guide/#requirements-files "(in pip v26.0)").

Unix/macOS

```
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt

```

Windows

```
py -m pip install -r requirements.txt

```

## Installing from VCS [¶](\#installing-from-vcs "Link to this heading")

Install a project from VCS in “editable” mode. For a full breakdown of the
syntax, see pip’s section on [VCS Support](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/topics/vcs-support/#vcs-support "(in pip v26.0)").

Unix/macOS

```
python3 -m pip install -e SomeProject @ git+https://git.repo/some_pkg.git          # from git
python3 -m pip install -e SomeProject @ hg+https://hg.repo/some_pkg                # from mercurial
python3 -m pip install -e SomeProject @ svn+svn://svn.repo/some_pkg/trunk/         # from svn
python3 -m pip install -e SomeProject @ git+https://git.repo/some_pkg.git@feature  # from a branch

```

Windows

```
py -m pip install -e SomeProject @ git+https://git.repo/some_pkg.git          # from git
py -m pip install -e SomeProject @ hg+https://hg.repo/some_pkg                # from mercurial
py -m pip install -e SomeProject @ svn+svn://svn.repo/some_pkg/trunk/         # from svn
py -m pip install -e SomeProject @ git+https://git.repo/some_pkg.git@feature  # from a branch

```

## Installing from other Indexes [¶](\#installing-from-other-indexes "Link to this heading")

Install from an alternate index

Unix/macOS

```
python3 -m pip install --index-url http://my.package.repo/simple/ SomeProject

```

Windows

```
py -m pip install --index-url http://my.package.repo/simple/ SomeProject

```

Search an additional index during install, in addition to [PyPI](../../glossary/#term-Python-Package-Index-PyPI)

Unix/macOS

```
python3 -m pip install --extra-index-url http://my.package.repo/simple SomeProject

```

Windows

```
py -m pip install --extra-index-url http://my.package.repo/simple SomeProject

```

## Installing from a local src tree [¶](\#installing-from-a-local-src-tree "Link to this heading")

Installing from local src in
[Development Mode](https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/development_mode.html "(in setuptools v80.10.0)"),
i.e. in such a way that the project appears to be installed, but yet is
still editable from the src tree.

Unix/macOS

```
python3 -m pip install -e <path>

```

Windows

```
py -m pip install -e <path>

```

You can also install normally from src

Unix/macOS

```
python3 -m pip install <path>

```

Windows

```
py -m pip install <path>

```

## Installing from local archives [¶](\#installing-from-local-archives "Link to this heading")

Install a particular source archive file.

Unix/macOS

```
python3 -m pip install ./downloads/SomeProject-1.0.4.tar.gz

```

Windows

```
py -m pip install ./downloads/SomeProject-1.0.4.tar.gz

```

Install from a local directory containing archives (and don’t check [PyPI](../../glossary/#term-Python-Package-Index-PyPI))

Unix/macOS

```
python3 -m pip install --no-index --find-links=file:///local/dir/ SomeProject
python3 -m pip install --no-index --find-links=/local/dir/ SomeProject
python3 -m pip install --no-index --find-links=relative/dir/ SomeProject

```

Windows

```
py -m pip install --no-index --find-links=file:///local/dir/ SomeProject
py -m pip install --no-index --find-links=/local/dir/ SomeProject
py -m pip install --no-index --find-links=relative/dir/ SomeProject

```

## Installing from other sources [¶](\#installing-from-other-sources "Link to this heading")

To install from other data sources (for example Amazon S3 storage)
you can create a helper application that presents the data
in a format compliant with the [simple repository API](../../specifications/simple-repository-api/#simple-repository-api):,
and use the `--extra-index-url` flag to direct pip to use that index.

```
./s3helper --port=7777
python -m pip install --extra-index-url http://localhost:7777 SomeProject

```

## Installing Prereleases [¶](\#installing-prereleases "Link to this heading")

Find pre-release and development versions, in addition to stable versions. By
default, pip only finds stable versions.

Unix/macOS

```
python3 -m pip install --pre SomeProject

```

Windows

```
py -m pip install --pre SomeProject

```

## Installing “Extras” [¶](\#installing-extras "Link to this heading")

Extras are optional “variants” of a package, which may include
additional dependencies, and thereby enable additional functionality
from the package. If you wish to install an extra for a package which
you know publishes one, you can include it in the pip installation command:

Unix/macOS

```
python3 -m pip install 'SomePackage[PDF]'
python3 -m pip install 'SomePackage[PDF]==3.0'
python3 -m pip install -e '.[PDF]'  # editable project in current directory

```

Windows

```
py -m pip install "SomePackage[PDF]"
py -m pip install "SomePackage[PDF]==3.0"
py -m pip install -e ".[PDF]"  # editable project in current directory

```

\[ [1](#id2)\]

“Secure” in this context means using a modern browser or a
tool like **curl** that verifies SSL certificates when
downloading from https URLs.

\[ [2](#id3)\]

Depending on your platform, this may require root or Administrator
access. [pip](../../key_projects/#pip) is currently considering changing this by [making user\
installs the default behavior](https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/1668).

\[ [3](#id4)\]

Beginning with Python 3.4, `venv` (a stdlib alternative to
[virtualenv](../../key_projects/#virtualenv)) will create virtualenv environments with `pip`
pre-installed, thereby making it an equal alternative to
[virtualenv](../../key_projects/#virtualenv).

\[ [4](#id5)\]

The compatible release specifier was accepted in [**PEP 440**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0440/)
and support was released in [Setuptools](../../key_projects/#setuptools) v8.0 and
[pip](../../key_projects/#pip) v6.0
