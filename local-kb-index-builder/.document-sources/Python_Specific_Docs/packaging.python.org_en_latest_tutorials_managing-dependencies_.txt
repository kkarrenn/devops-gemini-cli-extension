# Managing Application Dependencies [¶](\#managing-application-dependencies "Link to this heading")

The [package installation tutorial](../installing-packages/#installing-packages)
covered the basics of getting set up to install and update Python packages.

However, running these commands interactively can get tedious even for your
own personal projects, and things get even more difficult when trying to set up
development environments automatically for projects with multiple contributors.

This tutorial walks you through the use of [Pipenv](../../key_projects/#pipenv) to manage dependencies
for an application. It will show you how to install and use the necessary tools
and make strong recommendations on best practices.

Keep in mind that Python is used for a great many different purposes, and
precisely how you want to manage your dependencies may change based on how you
decide to publish your software. The guidance presented here is most directly
applicable to the development and deployment of network services (including
web applications), but is also very well suited to managing development and
testing environments for any kind of project.

For alternatives, see [Other Tools for Application Dependency Management](#other-tools-for-application-dependency-management).

## Installing Pipenv [¶](\#installing-pipenv "Link to this heading")

[Pipenv](../../key_projects/#pipenv) is a dependency manager for Python projects. If you’re familiar
with Node.js’ [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or Ruby’s [bundler](https://bundler.io/), it is similar in spirit to those
tools. While [pip](../../key_projects/#pip) alone is often sufficient for personal use, Pipenv is
recommended for collaborative projects as it’s a higher-level tool that
simplifies dependency management for common use cases.

Use `pip` to install Pipenv:

Unix/macOS

```
python3 -m pip install --user pipenv

```

Windows

```
py -m pip install --user pipenv

```

Note

This does a [user installation](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/user_guide/#user-installs) to prevent breaking any system-wide
packages. If `pipenv` isn’t available in your shell after installation,
you’ll need to add the [`user base`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/site.html#site.USER_BASE "(in Python v3.14)")’s
binary directory to your `PATH`.
See [Installing to the User Site](../installing-packages/#installing-to-the-user-site) for more information.

## Installing packages for your project [¶](\#installing-packages-for-your-project "Link to this heading")

Pipenv manages dependencies on a per-project basis. To install packages,
change into your project’s directory (or just an empty directory for this
tutorial) and run:

```
cd myproject
pipenv install requests

```

Pipenv will install the [Requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/) library and create a `Pipfile`
for you in your project’s directory. The [Pipfile](../../key_projects/#pipfile) is used to track which
dependencies your project needs in case you need to re-install them, such as
when you share your project with others. You should get output similar to this
(although the exact paths shown will vary):

```
Creating a Pipfile for this project...
Creating a virtualenv for this project...

Adding requests to Pipfile's [packages]...

```

## Using installed packages [¶](\#using-installed-packages "Link to this heading")

Now that Requests is installed you can create a simple `main.py` file
to use it:

```
import requests

response = requests.get('https://httpbin.org/ip')

print('Your IP is {0}'.format(response.json()['origin']))

```

Then you can run this script using `pipenv run`:

```
pipenv run python main.py

```

You should get output similar to this:

```
Your IP is 8.8.8.8

```

Using `pipenv run` ensures that your installed packages are available to
your script. It’s also possible to spawn a new shell that ensures all commands
have access to your installed packages with `pipenv shell`.

## Next steps [¶](\#next-steps "Link to this heading")

Congratulations, you now know how to effectively manage dependencies and
development environments on a collaborative Python project! ✨ 🍰 ✨

If you’re interested in creating and distributing your own Python packages, see
the [tutorial on packaging and distributing packages](../../guides/distributing-packages-using-setuptools/#distributing-packages).

Note that when your application includes definitions of Python source packages,
they (and their dependencies) can be added to your `pipenv` environment with
`pipenv install -e <relative-path-to-source-directory>` (e.g.
`pipenv install -e .` or `pipenv install -e src`).

## Other Tools for Application Dependency Management [¶](\#other-tools-for-application-dependency-management "Link to this heading")

If you find this particular approach to managing application dependencies isn’t
working well for you or your use case, you may want to explore these other tools
and techniques, listed in alphabetical order, to see if one of them is a better fit:

- [hatch](https://github.com/pypa/hatch) for opinionated coverage of even
  more steps in the project management workflow, such as incrementing versions
  and creating new skeleton projects from project templates.

- [micropipenv](https://github.com/thoth-station/micropipenv) for a lightweight
  wrapper around pip that supports `requirements.txt`, Pipenv and Poetry lock files,
  or converting them to pip-tools compatible output. Designed for containerized
  Python applications, but not limited to them.

- [PDM](https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm) for a modern Python package
  management relying on standards such as [**PEP 517**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0517/) and [**PEP 621**](https://peps.python.org/pep-0621/).

- [pip-tools](https://github.com/jazzband/pip-tools) for creating a lock file of all
  dependencies from a list of packages directly used in a project, and ensuring that
  only those dependencies are installed.

- [Poetry](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry) for a tool comparable in scope
  to Pipenv that focuses more directly on use cases where the project being managed is
  structured as a distributable Python package with a valid `pyproject.toml` file.
  By contrast, Pipenv explicitly avoids making the assumption that the application
  being worked on will support distribution as a `pip`-installable Python package.

- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for a single tool that covers the entire project
  management workflow, including dependency management, packaging, and publishing.
